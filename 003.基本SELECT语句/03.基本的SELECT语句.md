# 基本的 SELECT 语句

## 最基本的 SELECT 语句

```sql
SELECT 1+2;
SELECT 1+2 FROM DUAL;
```

- `DUAL`：伪表

## 列的别名

列的别名可以用双引号括起来： `field AS "别名"`

```sql
select employee_id AS "员工ID",last_name,salary from employees LIMIT 3;
```

## 去重

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department_id FROM employees;
```

## `NULL`

- `NULL` 参与运算，结果也是 `NULL`：

```sql
SELECT employee_id, salary AS "月工资", salary * ( 1 + commission_pct) * 12
 AS "年工资", commission_pct FROM employees;
```

- 处理 `NULL`：

```sql
SELECT
	employee_id,
	salary AS "月工资",
	salary * ( 1 + IFNULL(commission_pct, 0) ) * 12 AS "年工资",
	commission_pct
FROM
	employees;
```

## 查询常数

```sql
SELECT 'foobar',123,employee_id,last_name FROM employees;
```

## 显示表结构

```sql
DESCRIBE employees;
-- 或者
DESC employees;
```

## 过滤数据

```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
	employees
WHERE
	department_id = 90;
```

```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
	employees
WHERE
	last_name = 'King';
```
