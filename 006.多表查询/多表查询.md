## 引子案例

```sql
SELECT
	last_name,department_name,city
FROM
	employees AS e
LEFT JOIN
	departments AS d
ON
	e.department_id = d.department_id
LEFT JOIN
	locations AS l
ON
	d.location_id = l.location_id
WHERE
	last_name='Abel'
;
```

## 笛卡尔积(交叉连接)

```sql
SELECT last_name,department_name
FROM employees,departments; 
-- 或
SELECT last_name,department_name
FROM employees CROSS JOIN departments; 
-- 2889 rows
```

> 2889 = 107 (employees) * 27 (departments)

SQL92中，笛卡尔积也称为`交叉联接(CORSS JON)`，在SQL99中，也是使用 `CROSS JOIN`表示交叉连接。

出现笛卡尔积错误的原因：缺少了多表连接的条件。

## 两个表的连接条件

```sql
SELECT last_name,department_name
FROM employees,departments
WHERE employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

## 三表连接

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.last_name, d.department_name, l.city
FROM employees AS e, departments AS d, locations AS l
WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id AND d.location_id = l.location_id;
```

## 结论

如果有 `n` 个表实现多表查询，则需要至少 `n-1` 个连接条件，否则将出现笛卡尔积。

## 多表查询的分类

- 角度一：等值连接、非等值连接
- 角度二：自连接、非自连接
- 角度三：内连接、外连接

举例：非等值连接

```sql
SELECT 
	e.last_name , e.salary , jg.grade_level 
FROM 
	employees as e ,
	job_grades as jg 
WHERE
-- 	e.salary BETWEEN jg.lowest_sal AND jg.highest_sal ;
	e.salary >= jg.lowest_sal AND e.salary <= jg.highest_sal ;
```

举例：自连接

```sql
SELECT 
	e.employee_id AS "员工ID",
	e.last_name AS "员工姓名",
	m.employee_id AS "管理者ID",
	m.last_name AS "管理者名字"
FROM 
	employees AS e ,
	employees AS m
WHERE e.manager_id = m.employee_id ;
```

## 内连接和外连接

举例：内连接（SQL99）

```sql
SELECT 
	e.employee_id ,e.last_name , d.department_id ,d.department_name 
FROM 
employees as e 
INNER JOIN
departments as d 
ON e.department_id = d.department_id ;
```

> 举例：左外连接(SQL92，MySQL 不支持)
> 
> ```sql
> SELECT 
> 	e.employee_id ,e.last_name , d.department_id ,d.department_name 
> FROM 
> employees as e,
> departments as d 
> WHERE
> e.department_id = d.department_id(+) ;
> ```

举例：左外连接(SQL99)

```sql
SELECT 
	e.employee_id ,e.last_name , d.department_id ,d.department_name 
FROM 
employees as e 
LEFT OUTER JOIN
departments as d 
ON e.department_id = d.department_id ;
```

> 举例：左外连接(SQL92，MySQL 不支持)
> 
> ```sql
> SELECT 
> 	e.employee_id ,e.last_name , d.department_id ,d.department_name 
> FROM 
> employees as e,
> departments as d 
> WHERE
> e.department_id(+) = d.department_id ;
> ```

举例：右外连接(SQL99)

```sql
SELECT 
	e.employee_id ,e.last_name , d.department_id ,d.department_name 
FROM 
employees as e 
RIGHT OUTER JOIN
departments as d 
ON e.department_id = d.department_id ;
```

> 举例：满外连接(SQL99, `FULL OUTER JOIN`，MySQL不支持)
> 
> ```sql
> SELECT 
> 	e.employee_id ,e.last_name , d.department_id ,d.department_name 
> FROM 
> employees as e 
> FULL OUTER JOIN
> departments as d 
> ON e.department_id = d.department_id ;
> ```

## `UNION` 合并查询结果

- `UNION`：返回两个查询的结果的并集，去除重复记录
- `UNION ALL`：返回两个查询的结果的并集，不会去除重复记录

> `UNION ALL` 所需要的资源比 `UNION` 少。如果明确知道合并数据后的结果数据不存在重复数据，或者不需要去除重复数据，尽量使用 `UNION ALL`， 以提高数据查询效率。

## 七种`JOIN` 操作

## SQL99新特性：自然连接 `NATURAL JOIN`

> 自将各表中**所有相同字段**进行**等值连接**

```sql
SELECT 
	e.last_name, d.department_name 
FROM 
employees as e
NATURAL  JOIN
departments as d ;

-- 相当于

SELECT 
	e.last_name, d.department_name 
FROM 
employees as e
INNER JOIN
departments as d 
ON 
	e.department_id = d.department_id 
AND
	e.manager_id = d.manager_id;
```

## SQL99新特性：`USING`

> 简化 `JOIN ON` 的书写

```sql
SELECT 
	e.last_name, d.department_name 
FROM 
employees as e
JOIN
departments as d 
USING(department_id) ;

-- 相当于

SELECT 
	e.last_name, d.department_name 
FROM 
employees as e
JOIN
departments as d 
ON e.department_id = d.department_id ;
```
